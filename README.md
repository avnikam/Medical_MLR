# Linear Regression of Medical Costs 

## Introduction
The problem of predictiong medical costs is extremely important to insurance firms. Understanding how variables such as age, sex, bmi, number of children, smoker status and region can impact the charges the person might claim from an insurance company. 

This project aims to predict the charges of an indiviual given the below variables using various forms of regression. The description of variables considered in this project are as follows:

1. age: age of the patient

2. sex: gender of the patient

3. bmi: Body Mass Index of the patient

4. children: Number of children the patient has

5. smoker: Is the patient a smoker

6. region: Region in the U.S. the person resides in

7. charges: Medical charges in USD
